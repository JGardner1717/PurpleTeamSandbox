# PurpleTeamSandbox
This GitHub serves as a Purple Team Repository with files for different Red Team and Blue Team Processes (emphasis on the Red Team)

These are basic files that are not overly powerful on their own, but provide a great learning tool when used together.

When opening each of the folders, there is a ReadMe file under each section that explains what each section is for and how to use each file.

Below are links to some of the powerful industry tools that can be used with the files in this GitHub.
