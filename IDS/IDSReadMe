This is a very simple IDS that is focused on scanning running processes and flagging them based on various metrics. 

This tool can be used to test and see which of the Red Team processes leave a digital footprint that would be flagged by an IDS.

Not yet very complex when it comes to network IDS, but that is where Snort is a valuable substitute.
